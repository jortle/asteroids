# ChoccyMilk's Asteroids

## This project was a guided-tutorial from boot.dev to recreate the original asteroids game in python

The project from boot.dev is a pretty bare bones guided tutorial on how to make a game in python. I have added on many features and plan on adding more. Here I will list what I have completed and you can check the TODO file for what I want to add.

* Timer
* time score multiplier
* Score
* Triangle hitbox - the tutorial has the player drawn as a triangle but the hitbox is a circle. I have updated the hitbox to fit the drawn player.
