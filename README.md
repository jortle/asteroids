This project was a guided-tutorial from boot.dev to recreate the original asteroids game in python. I may continue it later and add some more stuff to it.

I have added a timer and am working on score tracking.

I want to add textures to the asteroids, ship, bullets, and background. As well as power-ups, different difficulties, and possibly modes.
